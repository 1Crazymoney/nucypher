Domain "leakage", or nodes saving metadata about nodes from other domains (but never being able to verify them) was still possible because domain-checking only occurred in the high-level APIs (and not, for example, when checking metadata POSTed to the node_metadata_exchange endpoint).  This fixes that (fixes #2417).

Additionally, domains are no longer separated into "serving" or "learning".  Each Learner instance now has exactly one domain, and it is called domain.
