Running a Network Node
======================

To be a node on the NuCypher network, operations are divided into two roles “Staker” and “Worker”. The Staker can be
thought of as a fiduciary administrator that holds NU and collects rewards. The Worker is bonded to a Staker and
performs cryptographic work on the network on behalf of the Staker.

Due to the complexity of running a node on the network, there are a variety of ways to participate depending on your
comfort level:

* Delegate custody of NU and work to a third-party custodian.
* Delegate work via a staking pool or `Node-as-a-Service provider <https://github.com/nucypher/validator-profiles>`_.
* Run your own node:

Here is a simple heuristic to help decide on a course of action:
